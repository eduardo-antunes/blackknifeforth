# blackknifeforth

Interpreter for a Forth-like language in a single file, written in C11. It's really
intended more as an exploration of Forth and its concepts, rather than as an actually
complete, fully compliant Forth implementation. If that is what you are looking for,
see [gforth](https://gforth.org/).

## Inspiration

My first and biggest inspiration to enter into the world of Forth was ratfactor's excellent
[web page](https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html), in which
he describes the history, the design aspects and many implementation details of the language. One
of the best things I read all year.

The name of this project is a reference to [stoneknifeforth](https://github.com/kragen/stoneknifeforth),
another Forth-like (with much greater technical merit than mine). There aren't really many similarities
between this project and theirs, I just thought the name was great and have been listening to
[black knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Us0DZgexw) too much.
